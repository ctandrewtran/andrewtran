Each ingredient contains certain amounts of vitamins, minerals, protein, and calories.  The marketing department has specified that the product be designed so that a certain minimum nutritional profile is met.  The decision problem is to determine the optimal product composition, that is, to minimize the product cost by choosing the amount for each ingredient in the mix.  The data is given below:\n",
